# üîç Operation Redbridge (2024) ‚Äì Digital Forensics Case Study

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive digital forensics case study conducted as part of the **Digital Forensics Semester Project**. The objective was to extract, analyze, and interpret concealed and encrypted evidence recovered during a simulated criminal investigation. The project focuses on a fictional case titled **Operation Redbridge (2024)**, involving allegations of sexual misconduct, evidence tampering, digital obfuscation, and forensic countermeasures.

## üìñ Case Summary

### Incident:
Anise Famke De Boer, a student and fashion model, accuses Nicolas Valentino‚Äîa fashion designer‚Äîof inappropriate conduct during a photoshoot session. After waking up under suspicious circumstances, she later reported the incident, triggering a digital investigation into Valentino‚Äôs devices.

### Key Allegations:
- Sexual misconduct and intoxication
- Deletion and destruction of digital evidence
- Intentional concealment of incriminating data

## üî¨ Scope of Analysis

- **Digital Image Forensics:** Extraction of hidden messages (e.g. steganography in "Wendigo.png").
- **Encryption Techniques:** Base64 encoding and Vernam cipher with key `thewendigo`.
- **Metadata Examination:** Tracking files and timelines for file access/modification.
- **Log Analysis:** Parsing system logs for user behavior and activity.
- **File Recovery & Artifact Analysis:** Inspection of high entropy and deleted files.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Study of chat screenshots, suspicious documents, and web searches.

## üß∞ Tools & Platforms Used

### Forensic Tools:
- **Autopsy** ‚Äì Comprehensive forensic toolkit used for:
  - File system recovery
  - Metadata analysis
  - Search index generation
  - Steganography detection

### Online Utilities:
- [Stylesuxx Steganography Tool](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/) ‚Äì Image analysis  
- [CyberChef (Immersive Labs)](https://cyberchef.immersivelabs.online) ‚Äì Hex decoding, Base64, Vernam cipher  
- Metadata and file entropy checkers (built into Autopsy)

---

## üìä Key Findings

- Encrypted communications using steganographic images and ciphers.
- Drug-related images and search history involving **Flunitrazepam**, **Rohypnol**, and **Hypnodorm**.
- Evidence of digital countermeasures: use of VeraCrypt, HxD hex editor.
- Aggressive chat messages and suspicious behavioral patterns.
- Highly suspicious files and documents pointing toward a possible premeditated offense.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Conclusion

This forensic investigation revealed:
- Clear intent to conceal and obfuscate sensitive data.
- Presence of tools and behavior indicative of digital tampering.
- Aggressive interpersonal communications and disturbing media files suggesting concerning motives.

The results support further legal action and warrant a deeper investigation into encrypted containers and metadata.

---

## üß™ Future Work

- Attempt decryption of the high-entropy SYSTEM file.
- Cross-reference metadata with external timelines and communications.
- Correlate behavioral patterns from logs with suspect interviews.
- Advanced steganalysis on other images in the system.
